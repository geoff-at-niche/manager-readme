# Hi, I'm Geoff

This is meant to be documentation on how I approach my role on the team and how I would like to interact with the team.
This is _not_ meant to replace us getting to know each other, which I hope will happen during our 1 on 1s and other
conversations/team events.

## What's my job?
- Retain and attract high-performing talent by taking care of the team and building the Niche engineering brand
- Set clear context for business needs, cross-team interactions, and individual growth
  - Goal: I can take a month off and things keep humming
  - Accomplishing that goal means that:
    - We have empowered leaders on the team with at least 1 month of clear context as to what's next
    - Effective relationships exist across teams within the company
    - We have a clear roadmap of prioritized upcoming work
- Part-time engineer, part-time firefighter, part-time cheerleader, part-time mentor
- TL;DR; Ensure the team is successful and happy and accomplishing meaningful work that aligns with the goals of the business

## What's not my job?
- My job is **not** to tell you what to do, or how to do it
  - Our product development process should inform _what_ to do to accomplish the goals of the business
  - I believe you are all high-performing, high-potential individuals: I assume that you know your job better than me,
    and that you will let me know if you are not set up for success
- That being said, I am responsible for the team's decisions even if I don't make them

## Why do I work here?
- I believe in the mission
  - There are some ways that we generate revenues that are important to the business that I'm not a huge fan of, but I believe we are actually trying to help people with our product
- I believe in the team
  - We are a group of smart, kind, caring individuals that want to collaborate and achieve success together
- I believe this is a great place to grow a career
  - Everyone has major impact, and there is always more responsibility to take on as the team continues to grow

## How I like to interact
- Communication
  - I'm pretty good at responding to email and Slack when I'm not in a meeting
  - Don't be afraid of interrupting me at my desk anytime
  - I prefer face to face interaction when possible - body language is a very important element of conversation for me
  - Meeting space should never limit our communication - I enjoy walking around the block and we can always go grab a coffee
  - My phone number is linked on the [Tech Team Wiki](https://github.com/nicheinc/wiki/wiki/TECH---Home). You can call or text me anytime. Literally.
- Feedback
  - It is critical that we be candid with one another. Disagreement is feedback â€“ it refines ideas and builds trust
  - Candidness is not orthoganal to compassion
  - 3 Metrics: Safety (should be high), Effort (should be low), Benefit (should be high)
- 1:1s
  - Currently I have monthly 1:1s with the whole team. That may change over time, but I still want to find time
    to regularly check in with the team. If you ever want to have a 1:1, just hit me up on Slack or send me a calendar invite
  - I'd like to avoid discussing status updates and instead focus on feedback for each other and discussion of your career,
    team dynamics, team strategy, and the larger business 

## My goals for the team
- We will assume positive intent and have each others' backs
- We will hold each other accountable and expect excellence in ourselves and each other
- We will always question our decisions/processes/tools and constantly ask 'why?' 
- We will learn together, laugh together, and take control of our destiny at Niche

## Work/Life Balance
I believe that productivity and effectiveness are maximized when we are happy and healthy. Work should never be detrimental to your life. If you need to WFH, or unexpectedly take PTO, just let me know. If you need to step out early, or come in late some morning, just let 
me know and plan to balance out the time over the course of the work week. I default to trusting everyone, but that _doesn't_ mean I'm blind to reality. Please don't abuse my trust and the trust of your colleagues.

I expect everyone to use all of their PTO each year, and I have no problem with people using their unpaid days. It's important to take vacations and refresh/revitalize yourself.

Sometimes I work at nights and on weekends. I don't expect you to. If I ever send an after-hours slack message or email, don't feel obligated to respond until the morning.

## Performance
If there are performance issues, I or your manager will let you know during a 1:1, well before any performance review 
has occurred. If neither I nor your manager has brought up performance issues with you, you should assume that things are all good. I've recently found a model for performance assessment and communication that I like:
- **Green**: there might be things to improve, but even if nothing ever changed, it's still good
- **Orange**: there is some behavior that, if not addressed in the long term, will not be sustainable. Some change is necessary
and we will continue to discuss, set goals, and measure improvement on that issue during 1:1s and performance reviews
- **Red**: there is a significant problem, and we are going to explicitly discuss the issue as well as the timebox for resolution. We will meet weekly to discuss progress on the issue

If you ever feel like you don't know where you are, just ask me. I firmly believe that it's possible to get back to green from red/orange, though it will definitely require some effort on your part. That being said, recovering from red/orange proves that you can accept feedback and are willing and able to change, grow, and improve. That builds a _lot_ of trust.

## Caveat
I've never written one of these before. It's possible that I've written something that you don't agree
with or that you don't believe I actually embody. Let me know. I need feedback to make this as accurate
as possible so that the team can hold me accountable.
